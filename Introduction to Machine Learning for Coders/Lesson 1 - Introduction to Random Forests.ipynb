    "Welcome to Introduction to Machine Learning for Coders! Lesson 1 will show you to create a \"random forest\" - perhaps the most widely applicable machine learning model - to create a solution to the \"Bull Book for Bulldozers\" Kaggle competition, which will get you in the two 25% on the leaderboard. You'll learn how to user a Jupyter Notebook to build and analyze models, how to download data, and other basic skills you need to get started with machine learning in practice."
