    "Functions do three things:\n",
    "    1. They name pieces of code the way variables name strings and numbers.\n",
    "    2. They take arguments the way your scripts take argv.\n",
    "    3. Using 1 and 2, they let you make your own \"mini-scripts\" or \"tiny-commands.\"\n",

    "You can create a function by using the word def in Python. I'm going to have you make four different functions that work like your scripts, and then I'll show you how each one is related."
