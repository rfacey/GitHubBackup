    "Python is called an \"obect-oriented programming language.\" This means there is a construct in Python called a class that lets you structure your software in a particular way. Using classes, you can add consistency to your programs so that they can be used in a cleaner way. At least that's the theory.\n",

    "I am now going to teach you the beginnings of object-oriented programming, classes, and objects using what you already know about dictionaries and modules. My problem is that object-oriented programming (OOP) is just plain weird. You have to struggle with this, try to understand what I say here, type in the code, and in the next exercise I'll hammer it in.\n",
