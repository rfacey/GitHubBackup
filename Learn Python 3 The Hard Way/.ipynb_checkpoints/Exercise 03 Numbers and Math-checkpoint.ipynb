    "Every programming language has some kind of way of doing numbers and math. Do not worry: programmers frequently lie about being math geniuses when they really aren't. If they were match geniuses, they would be doing math, not writing buggy web frameworks so they can drive race cars.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise has lots of math symbols. Let's name them right away so you know what they are called. As you type this one in, say the name. When saying them feels boring you can stop saying them. Here are the names:\n",
    "\n",
    "- +: plus\n",
    "- -: minus\n",
    "- /: slash\n",
    "- *: asterisk\n",
    "- %: percent\n",
    "- <: less-than\n",
    "- \\>: greater-than\n",
    "- <=: less-than-equal\n",
    "- \\>=: greater-than-equal\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the operations are missing? After you type in the code for this exercise, go back and figure out what each of those does and complete the table. For example, + does addition."
