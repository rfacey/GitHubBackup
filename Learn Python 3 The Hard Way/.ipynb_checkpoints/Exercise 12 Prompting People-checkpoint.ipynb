For input you can also put in a prompt to show to a person so he knows what to type. Put a string that you want for the prompt inside the ( ) so that it looks like this:\n",

    "- Q: Why does my pydoc not pause like yours does? A: Sometimes if the help document is short enough to fit on one screen then pydoc will just print it.\n",
    "- Q: When I run pyydoc I got more is not recognized as an internal. A: Some versions of Windows do not ahve that command, which means pydoc is broken for you. You can skip this Study Drill and just search online for Python documentation when you need it.\n",
    "- Q: Why can't I do print(\"How old are you?\" , input())? A: You can, but then the result of calling input() is never saved to a variable, and it'll work in a strange way. Try this,m and then try to print out what you type. See if you can debug why this isn't working."
