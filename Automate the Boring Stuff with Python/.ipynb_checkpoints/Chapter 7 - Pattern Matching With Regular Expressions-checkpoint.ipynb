    "You may be familiar with searching for text by pressing CTRL-F and typing in ht words you're looking for. Regular expressions go one step further: They allow you to specify a pattern of text to search for. You may not know a business's exact phone number, but if you live in the United States or Canada, you know it will be three digits, followed by a hyphen, and then four more digits (and optionally, a three-digit area code at the start). This is how you, as a human, know a phone number when you see it: 415-555-1234 is a phone number, but 4,155,551,234 is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions are helpful, but not many non-programmers know about them even though most modern text editors and word processors, such as Microsoft Word or OpenOffice, have find and find-and-replace features that can search based on regular expressions. Regular expressions are huge time-savers, not just for software users but also for programmers. In fact, tech writer Cory Doctorow argues that even before teaching programming, we should be teaching regular expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"Knowing [regular expressions] can mean the different between solving a problem in 3 step and solving it in 3,000 steps. When you're a nerd, you forget that the problems you solve with a couple keystrokes can take other people days of tedious, error-prone work to slog through.\"- Cory Doctorow, “Here’s what ICT should really teach kids: how to do regular expressions,” Guardian, December 4, 2012, http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/dec/04/ict-teach-kids-regular-expressions/.\n",
    "    \n",
    "In this chapter, you'll start by writing a program to find text patterns without using regular expressions and then see how to use regular expressions to make the code much less bloated. I'll show you basic matching with regular expressions and then move on to some more powerful features, such as string substitution and creating your own character classes. Finally, at the end of the chapter, you'll write a program that can automatically extract phone numbers and email addresses from a block of text.\n",

    "The previous phone number-finding program works, but t uses a lot of code to do something limited: The isPhoneNumber() function is 17 lines but can find only one pattern of phone numbers. What about a phone number formatted like 415.555.4242 or (415) 555-4242? What if the phone number had an extension, like 415-555-4242 x99? The isPhoneNumber() function would fail to validate them. You could add tey more code for these additional patterns, but there is an easier way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions, called regexes for short, are descriptions for a pattern of text. For example, a \\d in a regex stands for a digit character - that is, any single numeral 0 to 0. The regex \\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d is used by Python to match the same text the previous isPhoneNumber() function did: a string of three numbers, a hyphen, three more numbers, another hyphen, and four numbers. Any other string would not match the \\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d \\d\\d regex.\n",
    "\n",
    "But regular expressions can be much more sophisticated. For example, adding a 3 in curly brackets ({3}) after a pattern is like saying, \"Match this pattern three times.\" So the slightly shorter regex \\d{3}-\\d{3}-\\d{4} also matches the correct phone number format.\n",

However, by putting an r before the first quote of the string value, you can mark the string as a raw string, which does not escape characters.\n",
