    "# What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Two definitions of Machine Learning are offered. Arthur Samuel described it as: \"the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.\" This is an older, informal definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tom Mitchell provides a more modern definition: \"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: playing checkers.\n",
    "\n",
    "E = the experience of playing many games of checkers\n",
    "\n",
    "T = the task of playing checkers.\n",
    "\n",
    "P = the probability that the program will win the next game.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, any machine learning problem can be assigned to one of two broad classifications:\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning."
