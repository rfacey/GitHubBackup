    "\n",
    "Working well with your classmates is an important part of this online course. Thus, at the beginning of this course, we would like you to take time to break the ice and get to know each other. You may already know some of your classmates or have just met them. Establishing personal interaction with other students will make your online learning experience much more enjoyable and engaging. As such, we encourage you to participate in this activity, though it is optional.\n",
